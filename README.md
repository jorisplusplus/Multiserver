Multiserver
===========

Combine multiple servers as one  
Current minecraft version: 1.7.10  
Current forge version: 10.13.2.1230

This mod reconnects the client, no proxies or passthrough. So it should be compatible with everything.

The server sided mod allows people to switch server with commands and syncs chat with every server
The client side part is required to move automatically to a different server, but it is not required to join a server.

Check the wiki for more information.
